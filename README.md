# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction
This project predicts forest cover types in Roosevelt National Forest using environmental features. Machine learning models analyze elevation, slope, distances to hydrology and roads, hillshade, wilderness area, and soil type to classify each land patch into one of seven forest types.
